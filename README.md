# Three projects I had worked on with the help of PhD students from University of the West of Scotland

face recognition in real time - blurs face
- uses pre made open-cv classifier for faces
- when a face is detected a blurring box is drawn around the face

face recognition in real time - displays name of person
- in real time
- encodings for faces are made ahead of time (from a dataset)
- when a specific face from the dataset is detected, their name is displayed next to it
- if a face not in the dataset is detected, a message is also displayed

face recognition from image
- for an image only
- encodings for faces are made ahead of time (from a dataset)
- when a specific face from the dataset is detected, their name is displayed next to it
- if a face not in the dataset is detected, a message is also displayed
